# One a Day One Liners with Python

Everyday I add a new Python One Liner [to my Medium blog](https://medium.com/@jeremyfromearth). Sometimes they are deceptively simple but merit a deep dive and others just demonstrate basic language features. The motivation for this project is to keep myself learning new things about the Python language everyday and to encourage a wider dialog and collaboration with others in the Python community. Feel free to leave comments on the blog or better yet clone the repo and contribute to the project.

## One Liner Criteria
This project is just for fun and doesn't seek to enforce any hard and fast rules, but it does make sense to provide a basic description of what is meant by the term "One Liner"

> Note: These guidelines are completely subject to change!

1. All of the One Liners are going to be written with Python 3.6 and up.
1. One Liner should not __greatly__ exceed the line length as described in the PEP8, which is currently 72 characters. __Update:__ I have not adhered to this at all!
1. `import` statements don't count as lines.
1. One or two variables declared before a One Liner don't count as lines.
1. A One Liner should not use third party libraries. There is plenty to explore in the standard library!
