# One a Day One Liners with Python

Every day I add a new Python One Liner [to a thread on my Medium blog](https://medium.com/@jeremyfromearth/one-a-day-one-liners-with-python-2b2147611c6). Sometimes they are deceptively simple and merit a deep dive and others simply demonstrate pretty basic language features. The motivation of this project is to keep myself motivated to learn new things about the Python language everyday and to encourage a wider dialog and collaboration. Feel free to leave comments on the blog or better yet clone the repo and contribute to the project.

## One Liner Criteria
This project is just for fun and doesn't seek to enforce any hard and fast rules, but it does make sense to provide a basic description of what is meant by the term "One Liner"

1. One Liner should not __greatly__ exceed the line length as described in the PEP8, which is currently 72 characters.
2. `import` statements don't count as lines
3. One or two variables declared before a One Liner don't count as lines
